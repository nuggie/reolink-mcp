"""Capability gating: curated hardware-feature vocabulary -> reolink-aio
`supported()` string, plus a refusal-message builder.

Imports NO `reolink_aio` symbols directly (mock-seam invariant mirroring
`manager.py`'s own rule) — `gate()` takes a duck-typed handle exposing
`.host.supported(channel, capability)` and `.channel` (satisfied by
`manager.CameraHandle` without ever importing it here, keeping this module a
dependency-free leaf).

Consumed by `get_states`/`get_recent_events` in this phase's Plan 2, and by
Phase 3's control tools later for CTRL-10 refusals — same function, not
reimplemented (D-10).

# against the installed reolink-aio 0.21.3 source (02-RESEARCH.md Pattern 2):
#   - "white_led" consolidates the alternate spotlight vocabulary name —
#     Pattern 5 confirms spotlight and white_led are the identical
#     `floodLight` capability; do not add a second drift-prone key for it.
#   - "siren" maps to "siren_play", never "siren" — Pitfall 3: the raw
#     "siren" string gates the unrelated, out-of-scope set_audio_alarm
#     feature, not the set_siren trigger this project's CTRL-01 wraps.
#   - "ptz_presets" maps to "ptz_presets", never "ptz" — Pitfall 4: "ptz" is
#     true for any motorized optic including zoom-only cameras.
