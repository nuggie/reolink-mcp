"""Control tools (state-mutating): `set_siren` (Phase 3 Plan 1); `set_spotlight`,
`set_ir_lights`, `set_white_led` (Phase 3 Plan 1, Task 2); `set_zoom` (Phase 3
Plan 2, Task 1); `list_presets`, `ptz_move_to_preset`, `ptz_position`
(Phase 3 Plan 2, Task 2); `ptz_guard` (Phase 3 Plan 3, Task 1 — the ninth
planned control tool); `set_audio_alarm` (Phase 3 Plan 3, user-directed
checkpoint deviation — live P437 QA found `set_siren` is silently suppressed
by the camera while its audio-alarm feature is disabled, so enabling it must
be reachable from MCP too).

Tool functions here are plain, undecorated `async def`s — registration with
`ToolAnnotations` happens explicitly in `tools/__init__.py`'s
`register_all(mcp, read_only)`, not via an `@mcp.tool` decorator in this
module. This module intentionally never imports `mcp` from `server.py`:
`server.py` constructs `mcp` and then imports `reolink_mcp.tools` to
register tools against it, so importing `mcp` here at module scope would be
circular (same convention as `tools/observe.py`).

Every tool is capability-gated via `capabilities.gate()`/`refusal_message()`
before any host mutation call (CTRL-10) and returns a read-back confirmation
dict — the resulting state, read from the camera after the command, not
just an echo of what was requested (D-14). `set_siren` is the one documented
exception: no live siren-state getter exists in reolink-aio, so it echoes
the accepted command with an explicit note instead.

    continuous move — the same PtzCtrl command a joystick app sends while a
    button is held down. `direction="stop"` sends the camera's `Stop` command
    on its own and returns immediately; every other direction sends the move
    command, holds it for `duration` seconds (`PTZ_MOVE_DEFAULT_DURATION_S`

    clamped, same discipline as `set_siren`'s duration bound), then always

    (e.g. the call is cancelled mid-move). A continuous PTZ command has no
    camera-side timeout of its own, so skipping the stop on an error path
    would leave the head panning unattended.

    `speed`, if given, is passed straight to `host.set_ptz_command()`

    sent to a camera that doesn't support variable PTZ speed
