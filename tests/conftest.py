# Collection-time hermeticity stub (BLOCKER 1, 03-01-PLAN.md Task 1):
# `server.py`'s module-scope `settings = load_settings()` makes any bare
# `import reolink_mcp.server` config-dependent — including
# `tests/test_server.py`'s own module-top `import reolink_mcp.server`,
# which pytest executes during COLLECTION, before any fixture (including
# `tmp_config` below) has run. On a host with no
# `~/.config/reolink-mcp/config.yaml` and no `RMCP_CONFIG_FILE` set, that
# collection-time call would raise `SystemExit` and abort the entire test
# run. This block guarantees collection can never depend on the host
# machine's state: it points RMCP_CONFIG_FILE at a throwaway, always-valid
# stub config before any `reolink_mcp` import happens (including this
# file's own imports below). Every actual test still drives its own real
# config via the `tmp_config` fixture, which monkeypatches
# RMCP_CONFIG_FILE/CONFIG_PATH at function scope and fully overrides this
# stub for the duration of that test.

# The stub YAML alone is not enough: Settings also merges a repo-root `.env`
# (env_file=".env", resolved against cwd — the dev-loop convenience noted in
# `tmp_config` below). On a developer machine whose `.env` holds real
# `RMCP_CAMERAS__<name>__PASSWORD` entries, those merge into the stub's empty
# `cameras: {}` as orphan passwords and `load_settings()` exits with
# "no camera named '<name>' in YAML" — during collection. Trigger the one
# module-scope `load_settings()` (in `reolink_mcp.server`) now, with cwd
# pointed at the stub dir where no `.env` exists; the module cache makes every
# later collection-time import of `reolink_mcp.server` a no-op.
